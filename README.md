# Roman-Numeral-Converter

This is my completed challenge for the job application! It took me around 3.5 hours to complete and fix all the bugs I could find. Given more time, I would have liked to develop cleaner method of bringing the user back to the converter after entering in an invalid input. I just have the program throw an error if something comes in that's not supposed to and terminate so the program does not loop forever.
